# Python_Cat-Tower-Defence

# How To Use
To use it you need an IDE that can work in workspaces. I would recomend using Visual Studio Code as this is what we all used while developing the game.

This is because you need to set the root folder to `Python_Cat-Tower-Defence` after cloning the repository. This is so the program can access all the sprites and data it needs.

After doing this you need to run `Main.py` in the `py` folder and it should all work.
